     Foremost policies offer important standard and optional coverages that are geared toward motorcycles, and may
        not be available in a conventional auto policy. They also give you more security and value for your money.

    <h2>
     Motorcycle Coverages
    </h2>
    <p>
     Foremost started in the specialty insurance business over 60 years ago and understands the coverages that are
        important to you. Count on the AARP® Motorcycle Program from Foremost to provide customizable policies that offer you the protection you want.

    <ul class="bullet-red mb-4">
     <li class="mb-2">
      <strong>
       Collision.
      </strong>
      Insures your bike from damage caused by hitting things like other vehicles, trees or telephone poles, regardless of who is at fault.
     </li>
     <li class="mb-2">
      <strong>
       Other than Collision Coverage.
      </strong>
      Provides insurance coverage for other kinds of damage to your motorcycle such as fire, theft, flood, vandalism or contact with a bird or animal.      
     </li>
     <li class="mb-2">
      <strong>
       Safety Apparel Coverage.
      </strong>
      Automatically included with the purchase of Collision coverage and covers up to $1,500 in damage to any clothing, such as helmets and leathers, designed to protect you in an accident when the apparel is damaged in a Collision.
     </li>
     <li class="mb-2">
      <strong>
       Optional Equipment Coverage.
      </strong>
      You'll automatically get coverage up to $3,500 (with the purchase of Other Than Collision coverage) for most accessories permanently attached to your bike such as parts, decorations, custom painting, chroming, side cars or other items that were not originally provided by the manufacturer as standard equipment.

     For years, motorcyclists have tried to save money by canceling their policies during the "off" season. The
        problem is, you usually have several days during the off-season that end up being perfect for riding. Then you
        can't ride because you don't have insurance on your bike. Or, you have to go through the extra hassle of calling your insurance co     Eligible Bikes
