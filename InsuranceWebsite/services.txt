Popular services provided by car insurance companies typically include:

1. **Liability Coverage**: This is mandatory in most places and covers bodily injury and property damage that you may cause to others in an accident.

2. **Collision Coverage**: Covers damage to your vehicle resulting from a collision with another vehicle or object, regardless of fault.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Protects your vehicle from damages not caused by a collision, such as theft, vandalism, fire, or natural disasters.

4. **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage**: Covers you if you're involved in an accident with a driver who doesn't have insurance or has insufficient coverage.

5. **Personal Injury Protection (PIP)**: Also known as no-fault insurance, this coverage pays for medical expenses and lost wages for you and your passengers, regardless of who is at fault in an accident.

6. **Medical Payments Coverage**: Similar to PIP but typically covers only medical expenses resulting from an accident, regardless of fault.

7. **Roadside Assistance**: Provides services like towing, tire changes, fuel delivery, and lockout assistance in case your vehicle breaks down.

8. **Rental Reimbursement**: Covers the cost of renting a car while your vehicle is being repaired after a covered accident.

9. **Gap Insurance**: Covers the difference between what you owe on your car loan or lease and the car's actual cash value if it's totaled in an accident.

10. **Accident Forgiveness**: Some insurers offer forgiveness for your first at-fault accident, meaning your rates won't increase as a result.

11. **New Car Replacement**: If your new car is totaled within a certain time frame (often the first year), this coverage provides you with a new vehicle of the same make and model.

12. **Usage-Based Insurance (UBI)**: Insurance rates are based on driving behavior, such as mileage, speed, braking, and time of day, as monitored by a telematics device installed in your car.

These services may vary depending on the insurance company and the specific policy you choose. It's essential to review your options carefully and select coverage that meets your needs and budget.
