# Project Overview

This project demonstrates how sections are divided into different files as components and used in desired pages. Data can be passed among them in the form of variables called 'props'. The major work is done in the `App.js` file.

## Key Features

- **Component-based Structure**: Sections are divided into different files as components.
- **Props**: Data can be passed among components using 'props'.
- **State Management**: The use of `useState` is shown for controlling and modifying the value of a state variable across the page, as in the counter example here.

## Main File

- `App.js`: The central file where the major work is done.
