
## Key Features

- **Component-based Structure**: Sections are divided into different files as components.
- **Props**: Data can be passed among components using 'props'.
- **State Management**: Demonstrates the use of `useState` for controlling and modifying the value of a state variable across the page, as shown in the counter example.
- **Rendering Management**: Utilizes `useEffect` to perform actions on page refresh or rendering. Actions can be triggered on the first render, every render, or any specific page action (e.g., see in 2demoViteApp).
- **Value Management**: Shows the use of `useRef` to persist the value of a variable across rerenders and access DOM elements using 'ref.current' anywhere in the project (e.g., see in 2demoViteApp).
- **Rendering values**: Shows how a value is displayed from a variable or a list.
- **Event Handling**: Shows the use of event handlers like onClick or onHover effects and also input management for one or a set of fields.
